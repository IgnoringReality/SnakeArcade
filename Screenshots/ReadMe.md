This is the first screen (the home screen) which the player sees when the game is opened -

This contains the following buttons – EASY, MEDIUM, HARD, QUIT and ABOUT US. When the player hovers the mouse on any of the buttons, the text becomes bigger. For example, when the player hovers the mouse on the ‘MEDIUM’ button -

The clicking of the mouse on any of the buttons triggers an action. When the player clicks on the EASY button, the game screen appears which is having the difficulty level ‘EASY’ in which the speed of the snake will be low-

The blue block is the snake in its initial position, the green block is the food. The food appears at random positions on the screen. The player controls the movement of the snake by arrow keys with the objective to eat the food. 

ASSOCIATING KEY STROKES FOR THE MOVEMENT OF SNAKE:

1.	LEFT ARROW KEY: Changes the ‘x’ co- ordinate of the snake

2.	RIGHT ARROW KEY: Changes the ‘x’ co- ordinate of the snake

3.	UP ARROW KEY: Changes the ‘y’ co- ordinate of the snake

4.	DOWN ARROW KEY: Changes the ‘y’ co- ordinate of the snake

As soon as snake eats the food, its length is increased and another green food block appears on the screen at a random position. The score is incremented by one and is shown on the screen. The following screen shows the point in game where the player has made the snake eat the food block 7 times -

If the snake collides with the borders of the screen, a “You Lost” message appears on the screen and the game goes back to the home screen-

Clicking on “Return to main menu” brings back the home screen.

Clicking on the ‘MEDIUM’ and ‘HARD’ buttons on the home screen will display the same game screen as triggered by clicking on the ‘EASY’ button. The change will be in the speed of the snake. ‘MEDIUM’ and ‘HARD’ levels will have a moderate and fast snake-speed respectively.

Clicking on the ‘ABOUT US’ button which is placed at the bottom left corner of the home screen will show the following screen –

Clicking on the QUIT button in the home screen, or clicking the close symbol ‘X’ on the top right of any screen will close the game.
